NoodleMoodle Feature List

Nice to have:
-> Preditct average noodle consumption based on the amount of
the last times 
-> Noodle Statistics (=> Noodle Highscore, "Amount of Noodles needed", How many noodles consumed in total)
-> Noodle Broadcaster/Alarm (Let other people in the office know
when the noodle are ready, with beeping noise/or visual effect)
-> List with common foods to bring
-> Timer until next Noodle Day (upcoming Noodle Day Date)


If i have to much time:
-> switch between dark and light theme
-> webcam integration
-> Use v-if to use only one modal instead of two (maybe its no possible)

ToDO:

-> Make proper vegan/vegetarian checkbox label in participateModal
-> Change Vue js from dev to prod mode by changing the js file!
-> Implement logging in JAVA
-> alt tags for true/false icons (vegan)
